Viewing trouble?

Every human is one part of a larger, eternal design â€“ individual gears in a clock that has no end. Though you may not fully understand your purpose, your part is just as important as the greatest kings and queens of this planet.

Some feel as though their temporary lack of wealth or influence makes them powerless to create change. But does a clockmaker favor the larger gears over the smaller? Does the hour hand become jealous of the minutes because it turns slower?

Every part has a role in the functioning of a timepiece. Every part supports those around it in ways it may never see. Your absence would undo the Order of our universe, even if you do not realize your importance.
